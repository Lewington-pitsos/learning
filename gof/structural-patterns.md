# Structural Patterns

These are patterns that involve crafting singular classes or objects into larger structures. I.e. common ways you can get certain kinds of objects to play nicely with each other in order to achieve some higher functionality.

Structural design patterns differ from *structural class patterns*. The latter concern how to relate different classes together *specifically* using inheritance or composition in order to achieve larger functionality. For instance, multiple inheritance, where class C inherits from both classes A and B, is an example of a structural class pattern: it is a way of combining the separate functions of A and B into a more encompassing entity.

The substantive difference between *structural patterns* and *structural class patterns* is that the former can be altered at run-time, while the latter are irreversibly set at compile-time.
